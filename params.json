Other than that, who knows","name":"Game","body":"## Welcome to my game's dev site!\r\nI'm making a game in C# using the XNA framework. It's a 2D platformer.\r\nRight now I'm focusing on coding and getting something to work, rather than figuring out the premises of my game. I'm thinking Hitchiker's Guide theme, with Arthur Dent as the main character.\r\nOther than that, my game has almost no direction. Should be fun.\r\n\r\nHere is where all the action on my game's development happens. You can follow changes as they happen by clicking [View on Github](https://github.com/mattsains/game) above. You'll be able to see [what I've done so far](https://github.com/mattsains/game/commits/master), the [source code](https://github.com/mattsains/game), and what [still needs to be done](https://github.com/mattsains/game/issues?sort=created&state=open).\r\n\r\n###Have an idea for this game? Questions about it?\r\nPlease [email me](mailto:game.matt@sainsbury.za.net)! I'd love to hear from you.\r\n\r\n###Want to help?\r\nPlease do! [Email me](mailto:game.matt@sainsbury.za.net) and I'll help you get set up and put you in the loop. If you're especially brave, you can go right ahead and checkout the [git repository](https://github.com/mattsains/game) and start coding. (or drawing or writing or whatever)\r\n\r\n###Want to try the game out?\r\nRight now the game is very much in development. At time of writing, I'm using graphics I stole from a friend's game, there is one platform, the character cannot walk or jump, and collision detection is very broken. Also, there are no installers for the game, so you'll have to build it yourself. If that hasn't convinced you that my game sucks yet, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/mattsains/game/downloads) and prove it to yourself. Visual studio and XNA required to build."}
